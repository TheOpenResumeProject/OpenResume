# OpenResume
A standard for resume so that styling can be separated from the data.

## Background
Resumes have predictable contents but since there is no agreed upon standards,
everyone does their own thing. As a result, parsing resumes get complicated
for ATS systems: sometimes it misses things that you want it to catch.

The other issue is you are stuck if you picked a certain template. If you want
to keep the contents the same but would like to try a different look, you
cant do it without spending tons of time.


## Specification
A resume formatted with OpenResume is a JSON object. This only contains
the data part of the resume - formatting is separate concern. We envision
a template marketplace that can take the OpenResume specification and get
creative with the presentation. We plan on developing a similar specification
for styling/formatting/presentation in the upcoming days.

The parent object is called an OpenResume object. It contains several fields
that expands into more details. The following table describes the top-level
fields as well as the nested fields.

| Field Name | Data Type | Required | Values      | Remarks                      |

| data       | object    | Yes      | [See](#data)| the content of the resume    |

### Meta
`meta` contains a bird's eye view of the resume so that it's faster to
search/crawl/categorize.

### Data
